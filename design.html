        <h2>What is this game about?</h2>
        <p>
            My goal with this game is to make a great, multiplayer, open-world RPG. I want players to feel like they have unlimted freedom (while keeping the game fun) <br>
            and to have a very enjoyable first-person medieval / fantasy combat experience with their friends. I want to tell a story, but more importantly allow players to <br>
            make engaging stories of their own in a wide and open fantasy world.
        </p>
        <h2>Why make this game?</h2>
        <p>
            I've always loved video games, programming, music, linguistics, worldbuilding, and storytelling. My goal with this project is to combine all the different <br>
            things I'm interested into one major project, and to do it well. I've needed a passion project for a long time, and I'm excited to work on this one.
        </p>
