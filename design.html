        <h2>What is this game about?</h2>
        <p>
            My goal with this game is to make a great, multiplayer, open-world RPG. I want players to feel like they have unlimted freedom (while keeping the game fun) <br>
            and to have a very enjoyable first-person medieval / fantasy combat experience with their friends. I want to tell a story, but more importantly allow players to <br>
            make engaging stories of their own in a wide and open fantasy world.
        </p>
        <h2>Why make this game?</h2>
        <p>
            I've always loved video games, programming, music, linguistics, worldbuilding, and storytelling. My goal with this project is to combine all the different <br>
            things I'm interested into one major project, and to do it well. I've needed a passion project for a long time, and I'm excited to work on this one.
        </p>

            <h2>Inspirations</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Morrowind - for the RPG mechanics and its open-world, do-anything nature</li>
            <li>Skyrim - for its accessability and enjoyability</li>
            <li>Mount & Blade: Bannerlord - for its combat system</li>
            <li>The Witcher 3 - for its story</li>
            <li>The Wheel of Time - for its world</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Design Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Seamless multiplayer</li>
                <li>A vibrant, living world</li>
                <li>Fun & fast-paced combat</li>
                <li>An engaging story</li>
                <li>Player freedom and choice</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>How will it work?</h2>
        <h3>Database Design</h3>
        <p>
            - Main DB (to hold imortant data for each account)<br>
            - Auth DB (to hold important account info)<br>
            - per World DB (to hold important data for each world)<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Server Design</h3>
        <p>
            - Data server (to handle character and other non-per world information transfers)<br>
            - Data edit server (to handle edits to the databases)
            - Auth server (to handle authentication)<br>
            - per World server (to handle per world networking)<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Game server main loop</h3>

            - Server checks for updates from clients <br>
            - Server updates <br>
            - Server pushes updates to relevant clients <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Game client main loop</h3>
        <p>
            - Client checks for updates from the Server listener <br>
            - Client replicates updates <br>
            - Client renders <br>
            - Client polls user input <br>
            - Client updates <br>
            - Client pushes updates to server <br>
        </p>
